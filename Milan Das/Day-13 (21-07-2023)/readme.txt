LAMBDA

"""
	LAMBDA FUNCTION
	>	A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
	>	A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have 
		one expression.
		Example:
			lambda a : a*0.05
			lambda principal, rate, time : (principal*rate*time)/100
			lambda devident, dividor : devident % dividor

	WHY USE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS?
	>	The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous 
		function inside another function.
	>	Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that 
		the argument will be multiplied by an unknown number:

	CLASSWORK: (21-07-2023)
	QUESTION-1
	Write a program to calculate the simple interest value of 10,000
		>	Year = 3, Rate = 6.0
		>	Year = 5, Rate = 5.5
		>   	Year = 8, Rate = 3.5
		Use the Lambda function to evaluate the above problem

	Simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time_in_year)/100

	QUESTION-2
	Create a lambda function for the problem below:

	EXAMINATION PROCESSING
	1. If the aggregate is pass and the students fail in one subject, 
	   he can get 10 marks grace
	2. If the aggregate is pass and the students fail in two subjects, 
           he can get 8 marks grace
	3. If the aggregate is pass and the students fail in three subjects, 
           he can get 6 marks grace
