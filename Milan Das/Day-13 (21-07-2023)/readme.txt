LAMBDA

"""
	LAMBDA FUNCTION
	>	A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
	>	A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have 
		one expression.

	WHY USE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS?
	>	The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous 
		function inside another function.
	>	Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that 
		the argument will be multiplied by an unknown number:

	QUESTION-1
	Write a program to calculate the simple interest value of 10,000
		>	Year = 3, Rate = 6.0
		>	Year = 5, Rate = 5.5
		>   Year = 8, Rate = 3.5
		Use the Lambda function to evaluate the above problem

	Simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time_in_year)/100

	QUESTION-2
